# Emotions_in_Newspapers
This project was created during the hackathon culture.explore(data) @ Staatsbibliothek Berlin. I used a classifier for emotions developed by Leonard Konle et al. @ University WÃ¼rzburg to analyse emotions in the German newspaper "Der Tag" between 1911 and 1919 (https://lab.sbb.berlin/on-this-day/). I thank my team mates Alvaro, Fernanda, Jakub, Karin and Tim for their help.
